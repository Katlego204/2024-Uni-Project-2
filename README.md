## 2024-Uni-Project-2
This was the second project given by the school and I attached my attempt. 
We were tasked at creating an on terminal game,
The game was about self playing game, meaning we were just given the parameters and the game was supposed to play in a certain way
The game characters were "bees" and "wasps" as well as the "Hives" and flowers.
When the started the bees were supposed to go search for pollen in the flowers and when the bees found it they would bring it back to the hive
There were different types of bees like the desert bee, honey bee and the generic bee and they all had different capabilities.
The Wasps in the game were moving randomly while the bees were searching, and when they come across a bee they would kill the bee.
The game ended when either the Bees had collected all the pollen or the Wasps had killed all the bees.
